# 🔍 Powerful Binary Search Template & Study Guide

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm with numerous applications beyond searching in sorted arrays. This guide explores different **binary search templates** from basic to advanced concepts, with examples and tips.

---

## 🟢 **What is Binary Search?**

Binary search is an algorithm used to find a target value in a sorted collection by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Input array must be sorted.
- Reduces the search space exponentially.
- Can be applied to **arrays, monotonic functions, and search spaces.**

---

## 🟡 **Binary Search Variants**

### 1️⃣ **Classic Binary Search**

```python
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Found the target
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
    return -1  # Target not found
```

#### 🔑 **When to Use:**
- Finding an exact element in a sorted array.

---

### 2️⃣ **Lower Bound Search**

Finds the first position where the element is **greater than or equal to** the target.

```python
def lower_bound(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left  # Index of the first element >= target
```

#### 🔑 **When to Use:**
- Determine insertion positions in sorted arrays.
- Solve range queries like "count elements <= x."

---

### 3️⃣ **Upper Bound Search**

Finds the first position where the element is **strictly greater than** the target.

```python
def upper_bound(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] <= target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left  # Index of the first element > target
```

---

## 🔴 **Advanced Templates**

### 4️⃣ **Search Space Binary Search**

Used when we are **searching in a numerical range or function space**.

#### 🔧 **Example: Find Square Root**

```python
def sqrt(x):
    left, right = 0, x
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid * mid == x:
            return mid  # Exact match
        elif mid * mid < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return right  # Closest integer less than sqrt(x)
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Find Peak Element in an Array**

Search for a peak element such that `nums[i] > nums[i-1]` and `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.

```python
def find_peak(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid  # Search in the left half
    return left  # Peak element index
```

---

### 6️⃣ **Minimize Maximum Distance**

Find the minimum maximum distance when placing objects in a range (e.g., placing routers optimally in a house).

#### 🔧 **Example: Placing Houses**

```python
def minimize_distance(houses, k):
    def can_place_routers(mid):
        count, last = 1, houses[0]
        for house in houses:
            if house - last >= mid:
                count += 1
                last = house
        return count >= k

    left, right = 0, houses[-1] - houses[0]
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_place_routers(mid):
            left = mid + 1  # Try for a larger distance
        else:
            right = mid
    return left - 1
```

## 🌟 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Understand the Problem Space**: Binary search is not just about arrays but works on **monotonic functions** or **numerical ranges**.
2. **Decide the Template**: Based on the problem:
   - Exact Match → Classic Binary Search.
   - First/Last Position → Lower or Upper Bound.
   - Search Space Problems → Numerical Binary Search.
3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Empty arrays.
   - Duplicate values.
   - Boundary conditions.

4. **Debugging Tip**:
   - Print `left`, `right`, and `mid` in every iteration to trace the logic.
