## ✨ **Intro**

Binary Search is a conceptually simple yet powerful algorithm. At its core, it splits the search space into two halves, keeping the half likely to contain the target while discarding the other. This process reduces the search space exponentially, from linear Ω(n) to logarithmic Ω(log n). However, writing a bug-free binary search implementation is often challenging.

### Common Challenges

1. **Loop Exit Condition**: Should it be `left < right` or `left <= right`?
2. **Boundary Initialization**: How to set `left` and `right`?
3. **Boundary Updates**: Choosing between `left = mid`, `left = mid + 1`, `right = mid`, or `right = mid - 1`.

Binary search is not limited to simple problems like "find a specific value in a sorted array." It can tackle more complex scenarios with a systematic approach.

After extensive practice on platforms like LeetCode, a powerful binary search template has emerged, enabling efficient solutions for many "Hard" problems with slight modifications. This guide shares the template and practical tips to ensure you master its application and logic.

## ✨ **Most Generalized Binary Search**

### General Problem Statement
Minimize `k` such that `condition(k)` is `True`.

### Generalized Template in C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

int binarySearch(const std::vector<int>& array, std::function<bool(int)> condition) {
    int left = 0, right = array.size() - 1; // Define boundaries based on the problem
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Avoid potential overflow
        if (condition(mid)) {
            right = mid; // Narrow down the search space
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left; // Minimal `k` satisfying the condition
}
```

### Key Components of the Template

1. **Boundary Initialization**: Define `left` and `right` to include all potential values.
2. **Return Value**: After the loop, `left` is the minimal `k` satisfying the condition.
3. **Condition Function**: The heart of binary search; requires practice to design effectively.

### Advantages
- **Reusability**: Modify three parts for most problems:
  - Boundary initialization (`left`, `right`)
  - Return value (`left` or `left - 1`)
  - Condition function.
- **Reduced Bugs**: Simplifies handling of corner cases.
